					Oh my God. I didn't even know
					Smarties made a cereal. They
					don't. It's just Smarties in a
					bowl with milk. They just toss
					us away like yesterday's jam.
					From today, dialing 999 won't
					get you the Emergency
					Services, and that's not the
					only thing that's changing!
					Hello? I've had a bit of a
					tumble. Yeah, you need to turn
					it on... uh, the button turns
					it on. Oh really? Then why
					don't you come down and make
					me then.

					See the driver hooks a
					function by patching the
					system call table, so its not
					safe to unload it unless
					another thread's about to jump
					in there and do its stuff, and
					you don't want to end up in
					the middle of invalid memory!
					It's my term for my time of
					the month. Oh. What time of
					the month? The weekend? No,
					no, that's the music you heard
					when it come on. Oh really?
					Then why don't you come down
					and make me then. No, that's
					the music you hear when... I'm
					sorry are you from the past?
					Today I have a business empire
					the like of which the world
					has never seen the like of
					which. I hope it doesn't sound
					arrogant when I say that I am
					the greatest man in the world!

					Hello, IT. Have you tried
					forcing an unexpected reboot?
					He's had quite an evening.
					Someone stole his wheelchair.
					Did you see who it was? Red
					bearded man. I don't see how
					they couldn't just keep it as
					it was. How hard is it to
					remember 911? Dear Sir stroke
					Madam. Fire, exclamation mark.
					Fire, exclamation mark. Help
					me, exclamation mark. 123
					Carrendon Road. Looking
					forward to hearing from you.
					All the best, Maurice Moss.
					Graphic homoeroticism? Does
					that mean they're going to get
					them out? I'm a 32 year old
					IT-man who works in a
					basement. Yes, I do the whole
					Lonely Hearts thing!

					I am a man, he's a man, we're
					men! Ok, tell me how your
					feeling. I feel delicate...
					and annoyed, and... I think
					I'm ugly. Oh my God. I didn't
					even know Smarties made a
					cereal. They don't. It's just
					Smarties in a bowl with milk.
					No, no there you go, no there
					you go. I just heard it come
					on. From today, dialing 999
					won't get you the Emergency
					Services, and that's not the
					only thing that's changing!
					Shut up, do what I tell you,
					I'm not interested; these are
					just some of the things you'll
					be hearing if you answer this
					ad. I'm an idiot and I dont
					care about anyone but myself.
					P.S. No dogs! We don't need no
					education. Yes you do. You've
					just used a double negative.

					When I started Reynholm
					Industries, I had just two
					things in my possession: a
					dream and 6 million pounds.
					Yes! Yesterday's jam. That is
					what we are to them!...
					Actually, that doesn't work,
					as a thing, because, you know,
					jam lasts for ages. I don't
					see how they couldn't just
					keep it as it was. How hard is
					it to remember 911? They just
					toss us away like yesterday's
					jam. 0115... no... 0118...
					no... 0118 999 ... 3. Hello?
					Is this the emergency
					services? Then which country
					am I speaking to? Hello?
					Hello? I don't see how they
					couldn't just keep it as it
					was. How hard is it to
					remember 911?
