### Introduction

As a student in the Full Stack Web Development program, I am learning a wide range of skills that are essential for creating and maintaining web applications. This program covers everything from front-end web development, back-end web development, web design, and database management.

My intended future job is to become a Web3 developer . In this role, I will be responsible for creating and maintaining decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts on blockchain platforms. I will use a variety of technologies such as Ethereum, Solidity, and JavaScript to develop and deploy these applications.

One of my key personal goals for this term is to learn communication skills that can be applied in the workplace. This includes learning how to effectively convey complex ideas and information, how to collaborate effectively with others, and how to manage projects and teams.

 Additionally, I want to improve my ability to think systematically and innovate in order to solve problems and achieve goals. Finally, I want to improve my English to a certain extent in order to be able to communicate effectively with clients and colleagues in the international IT industry.

### Communication skills between different courses

This term, I will be learning the communication skills of organizing and investigating & questioning.

Organizing is the ability to effectively organize and structure information in a way that is easy to understand and use. This can include organizing written information such as emails and reports, as well as verbal communication such as instructions and process descriptions, as well as presented information like in a meeting or conference. This skill is important for making sure that information is clear and easy to access, and it can help to improve productivity and efficiency.

Investigating & questioning, on the other hand, is the ability to gather, analyze, and share information in order to better understand a problem or situation. This can include asking questions to clarify information, conducting research to gather new information, and analyzing data to identify patterns and trends. This skill is important for solving problems, making decisions, and for staying informed about industry trends.

I learned last semester that these skills connect to several communication skills that were learned from COMM-1173. Organizing relates to the communication strategy of organizing, which involves creating and using processes to organize and sort information. Investigating & questioning relates to the communication strategy of investigating, which involves using a variety of media and methods to learn and gather new information and solve problems. Additionally, it also relates to the communication strategy of questioning, which involves asking questions throughout a process to ensure needs are met.

Together, these skills of organizing and investigating & questioning are essential to have in the IT sector, as they enable individuals to effectively process, analyze and share information which can lead to innovation, problem-solving, customer service, and inclusive team practices.

These skills will be particularly important in my studies this term, as well as in my intended future occupation. 

In terms of my studies this term, organizing skills will be useful for keeping track of assignments and deadlines, as well as for taking notes and studying effectively. Additionally, investigating & questioning skills will be useful for conducting research and understanding the material covered in your classes. These skills will help you to stay on top of your work and make the most of your studies.

In terms of my intended future occupation, these skills will be important for a variety of reasons. Organizing skills will be useful for effectively managing projects and teams, as well as for communicating information in a clear and concise manner. Investigating & questioning skills will be useful for solving problems, making decisions, and staying informed about industry trends. 

In summary, these skills are important because they will help you to be more effective and efficient in your studies and your intended future occupation, they will help you to effectively communicate and collaborate with others, and they will help you to stay on top of the complexities of the field and make the most of your opportunities. 



### Common Themes in Courses

All my courses this semester have a few common themes that are interrelated. One of the main themes is the importance of effective communication in achieving goals and solving problems. This theme is evident in courses such as Business Needs Analysis, Creative and Systematic Communication, and Project Management and Agile Development, which all focus on using communication to achieve specific goals and solve problems.

Another common theme is the technical aspect, as all my courses include technical elements. This is evident in the Web Development course, which focuses on mastering PHP programming, and the Creative and Systematic Communication course, which is related to the technical field.

### Applying Communication Skills

The communication skills I will be learning in this course will be beneficial in my other coursework by teaching me how to effectively communicate ideas, thoughts, and decisions to others. This will help me in Business Needs Analysis to understand client requirements, in Project Management and Agile Development to manage projects and deliver solutions, and in Web Development to work with a team and understand client requirements. Additionally, it will help me to think critically and creatively, which is essential in the technical field.

### Improvement Area

One area that I would like to improve this term in my courses is starting assignments early. By starting assignments early, I will be better prepared for upcoming deadlines and reduce the stress of last-minute cramming. Additionally, starting assignments early will give me enough time to research, understand the instructions, and plan my work, which will lead to submitting higher-quality work on time and avoiding last-minute rush.



### Communication Strategies for Success

In this course, I will be focusing on two key communication strategies to improve my skills and performance. These strategies include:

Organizing: I will use the organizing strategy to effectively manage my assignments and deadlines. This will help me to stay on top of my work and to understand the material covered in class more easily. Additionally, I will use this strategy to take effective notes during class which will help me to retain the information better.

Investigating & Questioning: I will use this strategy to conduct research and to ask questions when I am unsure about something. This will help me to better understand the material covered in class and to solve problems more effectively. Additionally, this will help me to stay up to date with the latest trends and technologies in the field.

Goals for the course Aside from achieving a specific grade, I have set the following goals for this course:

Active Participation: I aim to improve my active participation in classroom discussions by asking at least one question per class session. To measure success, I will keep track of the number of questions I ask during class and aim to increase it over time.

On-time Submission: I aim to submit all my assignments on time and aim for a 100% submission rate. To measure success, I will keep track of the number of assignments I submit on time and aim to have all of them submitted on time.
