**Where do BAs report in your organization?** 

**Why do they report there?**

**Do you think there would be a more effective reporting structure? For example: Would it be better to report to a business manager or an IT manager?**

In my organization, business analysts typically report to a project manager or team lead, who is responsible for overseeing the overall progress and delivery of a project. The business analysts are usually part of a project team that includes developers, testers, and other subject matter experts, and they work closely with this team to ensure that the project is delivered on time and within budget.

The reason for this reporting structure is to ensure that the business analysts have the necessary support and resources to complete their tasks and contribute to the success of the project. The project manager or team lead is responsible for coordinating the work of the various team members and ensuring that the project is aligned with the business objectives.

I think that this reporting structure is effective because it allows the business analysts to work closely with the project team and receive guidance and support as needed. However, it is possible that there could be alternative reporting structures that could be more effective in certain situations. For example, it might be better for a business analyst to report to a business manager if the project is primarily focused on business processes and requirements, rather than technical implementation. On the other hand, if the project is heavily focused on technical issues, it might be more appropriate for the business analyst to report to an IT manager. Ultimately, the most effective reporting structure will depend on the specific needs and goals of the project.

What percentage of your time is spent using

- Business Knowledge,
- Technical Knowledge,
- Management Knowledge?

Which of the three types of knowledge has been the most beneficial in your job?



At the moment, I spend the most time on technical knowledge, because this part of knowledge is completely new to me and has some difficulty.But the reality is that management skills and business skills are the parts I'm missing and I should spend more time learning them.

For the future job,technical knowledge is likely to be the most important type of knowledge for programmers, as it is necessary for understanding how to write code and develop software applications. However, business knowledge and managerial knowledge can also be valuable for programmers in certain contexts. For example, business knowledge can help programmers to understand the needs and goals of the organization and how the software they are developing will support those objectives. Managerial knowledge can be useful for programmers who are responsible for leading a team or managing a project.

Overall, it is likely that a combination of business, technical, and managerial knowledge will be valuable for programmers in most roles. Therefore, it may be helpful to try to build a balanced foundation of knowledge in all three areas.



**Review the role of a BA in your organization and how the individual can positively or negatively impact a project or corporate initiative.  Share your findings with your classmates.**

A BA can positively impact a project by bringing a structured and analytical approach to the problem-solving process, serving as a bridge between technical and non-technical stakeholders, and contributing valuable business knowledge and expertise. On the other hand, a BA can negatively impact a project if they are not effective at gathering and analyzing requirements, or if they fail to effectively communicate their findings and recommendations to stakeholders. They may also cause problems if they do not have the necessary technical or business knowledge to understand the problem at hand or to develop effective solutions.

Overall, the impact that a BA has on a project or corporate initiative will depend on their skills and abilities, as well as their ability to work effectively with stakeholders and contribute to the success of the project.
