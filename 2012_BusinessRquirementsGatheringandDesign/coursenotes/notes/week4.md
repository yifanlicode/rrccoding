- Various approaches and their pros and cons

- When to use each approach

- Additional tools and techniques

  

### Outcomes

\1) Identify the various tools and techniques necessary for gathering Business Requirements

\2) Understand when to use different approaches



### Topic 1: Various Approaches to Gathering Requirements

#### **Why are there different approaches?**

Collection of information is at the core of analysis. At the outset, you must collect information about the systems currently in use. Then you find out how users would like to improve the current system and organizational operations with new or replacement systems. When gathering information, analysts are like detectives, knowing that there is a problem to be solved and looking for clues that will uncover the solution. Unfortunately the clues are not always obvious, so analysts need to notice details, talk with users and follow leads.

The best approach to gather requirements is to use a variety of techniques to ensure that the current business processes and the needs for the new system are will understood before moving into design. You don't want to discover later that you have key requirements wrong, because surprises later in the systems development life cycle can cause all kinds of problems.. There are two challenges you wiill find when planning your approach:

- Selecting the right stakeholders to draw information from - Analysts let the objectives and needs of the tasks drive the selection of the people that will participate in the analysis process. Think about each task and the information it requires and then list the people who can provide that information. You must include all of the key stakeholders in the process, because if they are not, then they could cause problems during implementation.
- Choosing the way(s) in which information is collected and creating a plan to gather information.

#### **Potential approaches**

There are five main ways to gather information with each having their own strength and weakness. Therefore you often find that analysts will use a combination of many techniques to complete the process. The following will identify the five approaches and provide a quick description of them.

| Type of Approach                   | Description                                                  | Strength                                                     | Weakness                                                     |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Interviews                         | There are twp types of Interviews: one-on-one and several people at the same time. | Allows for the collection of facts, opinions and speculations about the current system. It also allows you to observe body language, emotions and other signs of what people want and how they access the current system. | Gathering information from many users is a lengthy process   |
| Questionnaires                     | Used to gather information from a large number of people. They can be administered on paper or electronically. | Allows for the collection of information from a large number of people in a short period of time. It also allows for respondents to be anonymous. | Difficult to follow up on information provided               |
| Direct Observation/ Apprenticeship | Used to observe how people, the process and the system interact. | Allows for the confirmation of information gathered through other approaches | Users could misrepresent actual effort and process because they are being watched |
| Existing Documentation             | Review existing documentation to determine how the current system was intended to operate. | Provides insight into how the system was intended to operate | Modifications to current system may not be reflected in the documentation; risk of inaccurate or incomplete data |
| Existing System                    | Review existing system to determine current functionality.   | Provides insight into how the system currently operates      | The current system could represent functionality that is no longer used or in need of change. |





#### **Applying different approaches**

When you are on a project, you could use any combination of approaches to gather requirements. The following explains in more detail each of the approaches and when they are most effective.

Interviews

Interviews work best when you already some understanding of the system / process. Knowing the objectives and/or functionality of the current system / process allows you to facilitate the meeting so that you can focus on the areas you know are important. Otherwise, you are allowing the users to guide the discussion and they will want to focus it on what they feel are important.

However, sometimes this is not possible, so when an interview approach is used to start the process of gathering requirements, expect only to capture high level requirements so you can define the boundary and components of the system. Users may want to define detailed requirements and you will need to delay those discussions until a later day.

Questionnaires

Questionnaires work best when you are confirming requirements that were gathered by another approach. This allows the questions to be more focused and requires less time to manage.

However, sometimes the situation dictates that questionnaires will be used to gather requirements. In this situation you could limit the audience to only include key users so that the effort to review the responses is limited. An additional questionnaire could be used to confirm the requirements gathered with a large audience.

Direct Observation

Direct observation can be one of the approaches used to start the requirements gathering process because it allows you to identify the interactions between users and departments. You also start to understand the role the system plays in the process. However, at this time you are trying to define high-level requirements.

Direct observation also allows you to confirm requirements that were gathered by another approach. Users often talk about a process one-way and actually complete it a different way. Confirming the requirements by observing allows you to confirm that you have correct and complete information.

Existing Documentation

Existing documentation can be one of the approaches used to start the requirements gathering process because it allows you to understand the objectives and functionality of the system / process. Keep in mind when reading the documentation that it may be out dated and the current system / process may be different. It is this reason that this approach is not recommended to confirm requirements after they have been gathered by another approach.

Existing System

Existing system review works best when you already have some understanding of the process. This limits the time you spend trying to understand the different screens and how they work with each other. Systems are often built identifying only interaction points between users and system and the missing are manual steps.

As stated earlier, the BA could use any one or a combination of approaches when gathering and structuring requirements. Determining when to use an approach will depend on the type of project and the strengths / experience of the BA.

In the following topics, you will learn more about how to use these approaches.

### Topic 2: The Interview Approach

Review Chapter 5 of Mastering the Requirements Process for additional information about interviewing.

### Interviewing Stakeholders

In an earlier module, you learned about identifying and documenting stakeholders. This information is now used to gather information from them in various ways. The most common method is interviewing, although this should not be the only form of information you use.

Here are some tips for interviewing.

#### **Do's and Don'ts of Interviews**

There are a number of problems that may affect the usefulness of interview results. These are the most significant:

\1. There may be bias (conscious or unconscious) in the selection of interviewees. To avoid this, be mindful that you are including a sampling of all important stakeholder groups.

\2. There may be bias in the question process. The interviewer may present certain questions in a way that is likely to elicit a particular answer. The most common response to this problem is to give the interviewer little or no latitude (in wording, phrasing or inflection) in how questions are asked. The use of *closed* questions (the design of which you'll examine in a later chapter) is considered likely to reduce recording bias.

\3. There is a recognized tendency for interviewees to give the answer that they think the interviewer would like to hear. Again, the use of more structured interviewing techniques and application of closed questions are thought to act as a counterbalance to this problem.

\4. The interviewer may make straightforward errors in asking the questions or (more commonly) recording the answers. Several measures can be taken to minimize this problem:

- training interviewers in the general principles of interview conduct
- ensuring that they have an understanding of the overall structure and aims of the interview
- ensuring that they are fully briefed on the detailed format of the questions that need to be asked
- applying appropriate measures during the *pre-processing* phase of data analysis (which we will cover in a later chapter) to cross-check results in order to look for possible errors

\5. Active Listening helps to maintain the information flow and facilitates adequate feedback from analyst to interviewee. The active listening technique has five key tools:

- asking open- ended questions
- using appropriate words and phrases
- giving acceptance cues - nod or verbally acknowledge you are paying attention
- restating the interviewee's responses
- using silence effectively

\6. You will encounter resistance - outright, or passive - because you are representing a change that will cause uncertainty and even anxiety for some stakeholders. Remember that your role as a BA is to collect information, not to propose or defend solutions. 

#### Guidelines that may assist the interview process

**Plan your interviews**

- develop an interview plan - what are you looking to collect
- review organizational chart to determine who you need to speak to (clerical, managerial, executive)
- obtain approval to talk to the users

**Be aware of managers' bias**

- managers may want to choose the "right" people - those who they think will provide the most favourable responses
- managers may want to avoid the "wrong" people - those who they think will be critical
- managers may want to protect their workers' time
- managers may want to avoid discussing the project with people who will then ask questions or raise concerns



**Plan for efficiency and effectiveness**

- do work up front over the phone, email
- prepare a meeting agenda, questions (circulate in advance)
- keep the interview to an hour or less
- schedule a follow-up meeting to review material gathered

**Expect resistance during an interview**

- you're taking up too much of my time
- you're threatening my job
- you don't know our business, so how can you tell use what the new system should look like?
- you're trying to change the way we do things around here
- we don't want this system
- you're wasting our time asking these questions; what we want should be obvious

**Other potential problem areas**

- discussion that focuses more on implementation than requirements
- confusion between symptoms and problems
- users who are unable to say what they want or change their mind
- disagreements among users, managers

### Topic 3: The Questionnaire Approach

#### **Questionnaires**

Interviews are very effective, but they also are very expensive and time-consuming to conduct. Therefore, only a limited number of questions can be covered and people contacted. Using questionnaires as an addtitional source of information is a more passive approach that still provides value. While they will not yield as rich information as interviews, they are useful, relatively less costly (in time and resources) than interviews, and can be done quicker than interviews. There is also less chance of bias involved in interpreting their results.

#### **Steps to creating questionnaires**

To create a questionnaire, you must have a structured approach since you are not able to adjust your questions once it had been sent out to the users. The benefit of a questionnaire is that all recipients receive the same questions, and have equal opportunity to participate. Therefore it is important to take a structured approach to design an effective questionnaire.

#### **Plan the questionnaire**

The first step is to plan for the questionnaire. In creating a plan you are identifying:

- scope and objective - It is important to have this identified so you can clearly create the questions with an understanding of what you want the responses to be. Unclear or vague questions may not provide any useful information.

- A cover letter to explain the purpose of the questionnaire - most people will delete an unsolicited questionnaire, but are more likely to complete it if they have been informed in advance and encouraged to share their views. It is ideal to have the leadership of the organization communicate in advance that this information is important and will provide staff with their opportunity to have a say in the future system design.

- Choosing respondents - decide how many respondents are needed to provide an accurate cross section of end users. Use the organization chart to identify the business areas to approach to participate.

The major advantage of questionnaires is their high 'penetration' and their low cost, which is really dependent on the exact method of administration. The major disadvantages of questionnaires are their dependency on the reading and comprehension skills of the respondents, and the low initial response rates. It is considered absolutely critical to carry out some form of follow-up with those who don't respond. Of course, the more follow-ups one does, the more expensive it becomes and the more resistance occurs. There is a rule of thumb for surveys that indicate the following:

- 40% is a reasonable response for a first distribution
- If you send the non-respondents a reminder (after a suitable period) you might get responses from 40% of the 60% who didn't respond the first time. So now you have a total 64% response rate.
- If you contact the remaining 36% again, and you get 40% of those to respond, you will then have about 75%, and so on.
- After nine reminders you get - in principle - a 99.4% response rate, but you will have certainly worn out your welcome long before this point!

This is summarized in the following table:

![img](https://learn.rrc.ca/content/enforced/319259-235748/BSAD_Module3/images/pic008.gif?_&d2lSessionVal=938Jw4uZ0lsvWPqJ306O5Mbsu&ou=319259)

In practice, if the survey is well administered, after three reminders you may get a response rate close to 80%. Some people - for various legitimate reasons - will always say no.

Our concern with response rates is linked to the effect of low rates on the representation of the sample, and the consequent accuracy of the population estimates. Anywhere you get less than 100% response rate is in some sense a 'threat' to the accuracy and usefulness of the survey; the lower the response, the greater the threat. As you've seen, maximizing the response rate is a problem with all voluntary surveys.

You also need to decide if a questionnaire will be sent to different groups of people. Whichever group of respondents you choose, it should be representative of all users. In general, you achieve a representative sample by using any one or a combination of the following four sampling methods:

1. Convenient Sample - This method would send the questionnaire to a broad range of users with the hope that a majority of them will respond. However the danger is that only one department sends in the majority of the responses.

1. Random Sample - This method would select a certain number of people from each business area and the selection of the people from the areas would be randomly chosen.

1. Purposeful Sample - This method would select only people that satisfy certain criteria, allowing you focus on certain users. An example may be people that have been with the company for only two years or specific training.

1. Stratified Sample - This method would identify several categories of people you definitely want a response from and you randomly select people from each category. An example would be to randomly select users from the management team, front line staff, top sales people.

Planning for questionnaire identifying the scope and objective, number of respondents and who should respond will make the remaining steps more successful.

#### **Creating the questionnaire**

When creating the questionnaire, you must define the information you want and then create the questionnaire so that the response will provide it. There are two types of questions, open and close-ended. The following defines each of them:

**Closed-ended questions**

They are used when you want a precise answer to a question. Close-ended questions work well when the major answers are well known, allowing you to confirm information that was previously gathered. Another plus is that these questions do not necessarily require a large amount of time to respond therefore you can ask more of them and involve a wide range of topics.

Examples of Close-ended questions are:

- How often should the XYZ report be generated?
- What fields to do you think should be protected?
- What kind of error should be generated if the user types in bad data?

Advantages of Close-ended questions are:

- used for clarifying or probing questions or as feedback
- less time consuming for specific information
- makes note-taking easier

Disadvantages of Close-ended questions are:

- sometimes can get too little information
- may stop interviewee from volunteering information
- requires an excellent command of vocabulary and concepts

**Open-ended questions**

They are used when you want to probe for information. They encourage unconstrained answers that may provide large amounts of information, which may or may not be useful. These types of questions can be used when you don't have a good understanding of the problem or domain. Open-ended questions cannot be answered with a simple yes or no response and thus encourage the user to provide more information.

Examples of Open-ended questions are:

- What problems do you currently experience in your work?
- What kind of things would you like to change in the way you work?
- What type of reports would you like to see?
- Tell me what happens when a customer calls?

Advantages of Open-ended questions are:

- Greater freedom of expression
- No bias due to limited response ranges
- Respondent can quality their answers

Disadvantages of Open-ended questions are:

- Time consuming to administer
- The user may misinterpret the question
- You may misinterpret the response

Now that you have identified the types of questions that will be used, you need to determine how many questions will be included, taking into consideration the time it will take to complete it and the type of information you are expecting. A balance between the two must be monitored.

When creating the questions, you should reduce ambiguity. There can be two sources of ambiguity:

1. In the list of answers for close-ended questions. In the list of answers, if you include words such as "sometimes", "hardly", "frequently", each user will have a different interpretation of what the words mean and this will influence the responses. By creating clear answers, all users will now exactly what each mean. A clear answer could be "4 times per month", "once per week".
2. In the question itself. If a user does not understand a question, then they will not answer it or provide what they think the answer should be. This reduces the chances of you getting the information you were looking for. Therefore it is important to create clear and concise questions so that you get responses that will be useful and informative.

#### **Send out the questionnaire**

Questionnaires can be received and administered a number of ways; on paper, via e-mail, through a website, or an application developed specifically for questionnaires (ie Survey Monkey or other tool). The main difference between each of these methods is with the administration effort to gather and process the responses.

When the questionnaire is sent out, you should include a cover letter indicating the purpose of it and the expected time frame for responses. You could also follow-up with another letter reminding users to fill out the questionnaire and when you are expecting them to be completed.

#### **Administer the responses**

When the responses are received, you will group the questions together to review their responses. Depending on the type of question, you will be able to provide statistics about the responses to close-ended questions or create a list of responses to open-ended questions that will be reviewed for information. The analysis of open-ended questions will often deter people from using them on questionnaires because of the effort to review the responses.

### Topic 4: Observation Approach

### **![img](https://learn.rrc.ca/content/enforced/319259-235748/BSAD_Module4/images/pic003.gif?_&d2lSessionVal=938Jw4uZ0lsvWPqJ306O5Mbsu&ou=319259) Assigned Reading**

Review Chapter 5 of Mastering the Requirements Process

### Using observation - the BA as an "Apprentice"

User observation involves watching and listening carefully to users as they work with a product. Although it is possible to collect far more elaborate data using other approaches, observing users is a quick way to obtain an objective view of a product. Observation is often used to supplement or clarify interview information to give you a firsthand view of the topics discussed in the interviews. Observation provides the following benefits:

- observing a process in action allows the BA to see how the system genuinely works, as opposed to peoples' views or explanation of how the system works
- people often struggle to describe their work, especially if their work is highly specialized
- people commonly overlook many tasks, and misjudge the amount of time they spend 
- it is easier for someone to explain their work, as they are doing it, than it is to be interviewed on it

There are some disadvantages and challenges related to this approach:

- the presence of the BA may change the way people behave, especially if the BA is perceived as representing management - putting people at ease and communicating in advance can address this concern 
- the work being observed may not involve the level of difficulty or volume normally experienced during that time period
- some systems activities may take place at odd times, Ie. once a month, only certain times throughout the year
- may be inconvenient or disruptive
- work being observed may be subject to various types of interruptions

#### **Preparing for user observation**

Before you do any observing, you should take time to figure out what you are and are not looking for. In determining an objective, you can focus on specific activities / processes. By limiting the scope, you're more likely to get information that helps you instead of overwhelming you.

The users will work through one or more specific tasks, which should be real tasks so that you can see actual interactions with the system. The entire observation should not run over an hour, allowing you to properly document your findings. With this format, you may need several sessions to observe all of the activities within your objective.

Important: You must be clear in explaining the purpose of the observation to the users. If the users feel threatened in any way, it may alter their routine so that you do not get a true picture of how they process transactions and interact with the system. Therefore, it becomes very important to be clear and upfront with the users explaining the purpose and objective of observing them.

Finding a good time to observe is also important. The observation should be carried out for a period of time and at different time intervals, not just once, so that the analyst can observe different workloads and to ensure that what the user does is consistent over different periods of time. Ideally you want to observe when the users are busy because you can observe the performance of a system and identify any shortcuts the users may take. However, this can also be the most disruptive time for the users. Therefore, it is recommended that you initially observe when it is slow so that you can document the entire process and then confirm the findings when it becomes busy. This also allows you to highlight tasks that are omitted during the busy times.

Selecting user(s) should be carefully planned. Obviously you want users that most familiar with the process / system, however you also need to consider users that are open to improvements. You want users that will be open to discuss what works well, what needs improvement and what they think would improve the process / system. Be careful if the department manager wants to be the person observed because they often are not the user doing the day-to-day work. They will think that they know what their department is doing, but often you find out that they know the high level tasks, not the details required for your documentation. You may want to ask pairs of people to work together on tasks because you will find that they talk more about the process and they tend to discuss features of the product.

#### **Steps to observing users**

The following instructions guide you through a simple observation. These instructions are organized into steps with some explanation and a bulleted list. The bulleted list contains sample statements that you can read to the participant.

*1. Introduce yourself.*

Describe the purpose of the observation (in general terms).

Set the participant at ease by stressing that you're trying to find problems / enhancements in the process / system. For example, you could say some of the following statements:

*"We're looking for places where the system may be difficult to use."*

*"If you have trouble with some of the tasks, don't feel bad; that's exactly what we're looking for so we can go back and improve the process / system."*

*2. Tell the participant that it's okay to ask you to stop the observation.*

Never leave this step out. Make sure you inform participants that they can stop the observation at any time if they find themselves becoming uncomfortable. Participants shouldn't feel like they're locked into the observation. You could always find someone else or come back a better time.

*3. Explain how to "think aloud."*

Ask participants to think aloud during the observation, saying what comes to mind as they work. By listening to participants think and plan, you can examine their expectations for the process / system, as well as their intentions and their problem solving strategies. You'll find that listening to users as they work provides you with an enormous amount of useful information that you can get no other way.

Unfortunately, most people feel awkward or self-conscious about thinking aloud. Explain why you want participants to think aloud, and demonstrate how to do it. For example, you could say:

*"We have found that we get a great deal of information from observations if we ask people to think aloud as they work through the activity. It may be a bit awkward at first, but it's really very easy once you get used to it. All you do is speak your thoughts as you work. If you forget to think aloud, I'll remind you to keep talking."
*

*4. Allow the user to ask questions*

Allowing the user to ask questions before the observation begins or during it will hopefully address any concerns they may have. As stated earlier, you want the user to be comfortable with being observed so that you obtain complete and correct requirements.

*5. Conclude the observation.*

When the test is over:

- Explain what you were trying to find out during the test.
- Answer any remaining questions the participant may have.
- Discuss any interesting behaviours you would like the participant to explain.


To get the most out of your results, review all your data carefully and thoroughly looking for places where participants had trouble, and see if you can determine how the process / system could be changed to alleviate the problems. It's also a good idea to keep a record of what you found during the test. That way, you have documentation to support your decisions and you can see trends in users' behaviour.



### Topic 5 Review of Existing System Approach

Analysis of an existing system allows analysts to walk through the interaction between users and systems. Users and existing documentation provide views on how the interaction with the system occurs, but allowing the analyst to experience it themselves provides additional insight into issues or concerns.

#### **Review of Existing Systems**

Log onto the system and walk through the steps a user would follow to complete their task / activity. You will go through each screen and run each process, imitating everything that the user would be doing. This should provide you with the following information:

\1. The number of steps to complete the task /activity.

- The number of steps usually provides some indication on the amount of effort to complete the task / activity. When there are more steps involved, it would increase the effort. If you are doing a time study, you could also use the steps as milestones to indicate time intervals.

- This information could also assist with the design of the new system, where you may try to decrease the amount of effort / time / number of steps to complete the task / activity. This then becomes a benefit later to promote the new system / application to users.

\2. The amount of information collected

- As with the previous point, the amount of information is also related to the effort and time to complete the task /activity. Looking for ways to reduce the amount of information could also be promoted as a benefit.

\3. The type of information collected

- With a review of the type of information collected, we can determine if it is new information or information that is captured within the system that could be pre-populated onto the screen. Pre-filling information into a screen reduces the effort and time to compete a step and removes the possibility for errors in data entry.

\4. Where the information comes from

- Knowing where the information comes from allows you to verify that you have reviewed all sources of data for the new system. It also allows you to review the possibility of having the data entered at source. Having data entered at its source has been shown to reduce costs and promote complete / correct information.

\5. The performance of the system

- While working with the system, you can experience the performance of the system and validate any concerns that were raised by the users. Some of the performance areas could be:
  - Updating data to a table
  - Time to run a process
  - Time to switch between screens
- This information also creates a benchmark for determining if performance of the new system has improved.

\6. The design of the system

- Working with the system also allows you to review the interaction points and determine if they are "user friendly". The following are some ideas on what can make a screen user friendly:
  - Does the cursor move in a logical manner through the screen? ie. From left to right, top to bottom.
  - Can you easily move the cursor back to the previous field?
  - Can you easily modify fields?
  - Is moving around the screen or navigating to a different screen easy to do (intuitive)?
  - Can you access help on a specific field / screen?
  - Does the screen provide clear error messages / feedback?
  - Is the font readable? Are there appropriate accessibility features offered?
  - Can you view all of the fields on the screen or is the user required to scroll up / down or sideways?

**Use of test environments**

For some business areas, it will not be possible to use live systems because it would distort financial information or change important data that is being used. In these situations, it will be necessary to use a test version of the system / application. However there are several things to remember when working with test versions:

- they typically do not contain the same amount of data that a production system would have and this could impact the amount of time it takes to run activities
- data may be missing or outdated and cause the process to not run or produce invalid data
- enhancements that were made to the production version may not be on the test system, because the test system was only used when the system was first created
- enhancements that are not on the production version already exist on the test system because they have not been rolled out
- interfaces or integrations with other systems may not be active

Overall, a review of the existing system can be beneficial to experience first hand what the users do and how they work with the system each day. It also provides a way to validate information that had been collected through other approaches.

### TOPIC 6: OTHER TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES

**Remember the rule - requirements are not a solution.** The BA needs to learn the requirements before a solution can be determined. The project will not succeed if the solution is determined beforehand. Here are some additional tips to guide your work.



#### GETTING TO THE ESSENCE OF THE WORK

- Much of the information provided will be a stakeholder's idea for a solution
- It is the BA's role to keep them focused on the need not any particular solution
- The problem must be identified before any solution is considered
- If a requirement contains the means of implementation, it is a solution not a requirement
- Clients do not understand the nature of requirements gathering
- It is also very important to solve the right problem; revisit your project scope and goals to stay on track

#### OTHER TOOLS & TECHNIQUES TO GENERATE REQUIREMENTS

In the previous lessons in this module, you learned about common approaches to gathering information. Here are some additional tools and techniques that are useful.

**Scenarios**

- Scenarios are useful because they are easy for stakeholders to understand
- When done properly, using scenarios to discuss requirements will help validate how the new system will be used and how it must function

**Creativity workshops**

- Sessions that allow stakeholders and team members to think past the current situation
- Must focus on the goal and stay focused
- Effective when there are a large amount of stakeholders

**Brainstorming**

- Effective for any type of project
- Allows everyone to express their ideas
- Takes advantage of group effort
- Must involve representatives from all areas
- Requires strong facilitation

**Personas**

- Invented personality representing each key stakeholder and end user
- Useful when clients are not available to interview

**Mind maps**

- This is a drawing and text combination that attempts to represent the information by making associations
- Useful for organizing thoughts
- Provides enough information expressed in key words and links to get the overall picture

## SUMMARY

This module covered the various approaches, tools and techniques necessary for effective gathering of business requirements. After completing this module:

- Can you understand how identifying stakeholders is connected to gathering inputs for business requirements?
- Do you know the pros and cons of each of the main approaches to gathering inputs for business requirements?
- Can you envision using these approaches on a project?
- Do you know what other tools you might use to help illustrate or gather information?

In the next module you will learn about writing business requirements now that you have gathering information from many sources.![image-20230205202519125](/Users/liyifan/Library/Application%20Support/typora-user-images/image-20230205202519125.png)
