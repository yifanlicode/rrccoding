Module 5 â€“ Writing Effective Business Requirements

## MODULE 5: INTRODUCTION

1. Identify the difference between a business requirement and a solution

   A business requirement is a statement of what a business needs in order to function effectively and efficiently. It outlines the specific features or capabilities that a business requires in order to meet its objectives.

   A solution, on the other hand, is a response to a business requirement. It is a proposed or actual system, process, or product that addresses the business requirement and provides the necessary functionality. A solution is the practical implementation of a business requirement.

   In short, a business requirement defines what the business needs, while a solution is the answer to that need.

2. Explain why business requirements must be measurable and testable

   Business requirements must be measurable and testable to ensure that the desired outcomes of a project can be objectively evaluated. Measurable requirements provide a clear and specific target for the project, making it easier to determine if the project has been successful or not. Testable requirements can be verified through testing, allowing project managers and stakeholders to determine if the requirements have been met. This also helps ensure that the final solution meets the needs of the business and achieves its desired goals. Additionally, measurable and testable requirements provide a clear basis for making decisions during the project and for evaluating the results after the project has been completed.

3. Name the key elements in the Volere business requirements template

4. Apply effective writing techniques

5. Identify how to design requirements for iterative systems development projects



## TOPIC 1: REQUIREMENTS VS SOLUTIONS

Remember that a business requirement is written to describe a need that is driven by a business objective. In an earlier module we recommended that you look at your project purpose as solving a problem.

It is very common for project team stakeholders to confuse requirements with solutions. The intention of an effective list of business requirements is that they list the needs (requirements) that a system has to have to meet the requirements of the client and end users, while also considering risks, constraints and other relevant information. Requirements are not solutions. 

> **Don't presuppose a design solution, or enforce a solution, by the way you write a requirement.**
>
> For example, if you wrote a requirement that says: *The product shall require a password to access account data*, you have forced the designer to use as a password as the solution.
>
> Instead, you could write this statement which would encourage the designer to find the most effective solution: *The product shall ensure account data can be accessed only by authorized users.*

In practice, when well done, business requirements will be a document that you will continue to revisit as you proceed through the project implementation. They become a benchmark that you can measure and test against. I**n fact, part of your goal as a BA is to write effective requirements that are not solutions, and can be both measured and tested.** This will be further explained in subsequent modules in this course.



## TOPIC 2: WRITING TECHNIQUES

#### WRITING TECHNIQUE

Techniques that will improve your written content are based on making your requirements as clear and easily understandable as possible.

- Use simple english with simple sentence structure, for example:
- Write each requirement to stand on its own; it should be clear and concise and define one requirement only. 

#### CONTENT

Planning and organizing your content includes considering the following items:

- Your requirement is clear and is something that can be measured

- Your requirement includes a rating - is it critical, wanted (and an item the client is willing to pay for) or desired (but not currently willing to be paid for)

- Your requirement has a clear business owner

- Your requirement does not force a solution

- Your requirement describes capability that is needed, without defining a solution -

   

  hint: if you are describing how something should work or how something should be done, that is a solution, not a requirement. 


#### FORMALITY GUIDE

Not every project requires the same level of detail, or format. Throughout the textbook, you will see examples of rabbit, horse and elephant projects.

How you communicate and package your requirements will depend on the scope of your project as well as the way the project is being managed. We will give examples of how iterative systems projects approach business requirements later in this module. 

Review the chapter to familiarize yourself with the different levels of formality.

#### TOOLS AND TEMPLATES

Your organization (or the client) may have a specific template your requirements have to use. In some cases, requirements are written in an automated tool or software.

For the purpose of this course, we will follow a standard template covered in the next lesson. 

### TOPIC 3: VOLERE TEMPLATE

Review Appendix A of Mastering the Requirements Process

The Volere Requirements Specification Template provides a guide for writing comprehensive requirements for systems development projects. The template includes sections that are appropriate for many types of systems projects. It organizes requirements by groupings and sections, and provides content guidelines to help you complete each section.

In reviewing the template, you will see how the previous module content begin to form contents you will add to this template, for example:

- Project drivers - project purpose and stakeholders
- Project constraints
- Functional requirements
- Nonfunctional requirements
- Project issues and considerations

A copy of the template is provided for you to download. It is to be used for academic purposes only. Any commercial use of this template is prohibited unless paid for through the publisher's website. You may modify it to use as a basis for your requirements document, but you may not copy it or use it for any purpose other than your academic work.

The Volere template will allow you to discover and communicate your requirements, regardless of the type of project or the methodology used to manage your projects. In the next lesson, we will discuss how using an iterative process for systems development affects business requirements.



The Volere Requirements Specification Template is intended for use as a basis for discovering and communicating your requirements. The template provides sections for each of the requirements types appropriate to today's software systems.  The template is process independent and can be used by Agile, Traditional, and Outsourced projects. The template can be used with any combination of automated tools you are using see http://www.volere.co.uk/tools.htm for a summary of available tools.

### TOPIC 4: ADAPTING APPROACH FOR ITERATIVE PROJECTS

Today, it is growing far more common to manage projects using Agile methods. Instead of traditional "waterfall" management, where systems projects go through distinct sequential phases, moving from completing all requirements to design, Agile methods use an iterative process.

This means that instead of waiting for every detail of requirements to be defined, requirements will be done in increments that would define some of the requirements, develop and test part of the design of the solution, receive input and approval from the client, and so on. In essence, the system is being defined, designed and tested in pieces that eventually total the end to end system.

The benefit to this process is that the client and end users are able to see and provide input on the product being developed, as it is being developed. As well, any issues or concerns will be raised early and can be addressed before continuing to replicate issues or problems throughout the system.

Many people have the misconception that completing projects in an agile manner means no requirements are defined. It is also commonly misunderstood that agile projects do not contain documentation, or that documentations is limited.

This is not true. While the manner in which agile projects are managed is different, the process of gathering information and creating requirements is similar. The key difference is the process is collaborative by design. Small teams work together to help define business needs with a focus on the end user. These are written in the form of user stories.

#### USER STORIES

User stories are extremely valuable method for defining what functionality is needed for a system, or a part of a system. They are written in the following format:

- As a [ role ]. I want [ feature] so that [ reason ]

> Example: *As an insurance adjuster, I want a list of outstanding claims so that I can see my workload for the day.*

#### CHECK FOR UNDERSTANDING:

Can you see the value of developing requirements in this way?

Do you see the correlation between the previous elements we have studied and how they are still relevant, regardless of the manner in which the project is managed?

### Summary

Writing requirements involves much more than simply gathering information and putting it into words in a random way.

In this module you have discovered that the process of writing effective requirements brings together information gathering, inputs from many sources, critical thinking and writing skills with a method to ensure the requirements are complete and aligned with solving the business problem, or goal, of the project, without proposing a specific solution.

- Can you understand the difference between a requirement and a solution, and why it is important to avoid solutions?
- Do you see how stakeholders and the project team must work in syncronization to help define requirements?
- What are the advantages and disadvantages to developing business requirements using an iterative process?
