## Module 3 â€“ Getting Started on a Systems Development Project

 [toc]



### Topics

#### 1.Project kickoff 

> This refers to the initial phase of a systems development project where the project team is assembled, objectives are defined and the overall project plan is established. This is the starting point of the project where the project team is formed, stakeholders are identified and the project scope is defined.

#### 2. Scope

> The scope of a project refers to the specific deliverables and objectives that need to be achieved for the project to be considered successful. It outlines what the project will and will not include, and serves as a guide for the project team to focus on the tasks necessary to complete the project.

To build the right product, you have to understand the extent of the work; the people who do it, influence it or know about it; and the outcomes that those people are trying to achieve. This is the **trinity of scope, stakeholders and goals.** All three are critical to developing business requirements.

- Scope is the extent of the business area that will be affected
- Stakeholders are those who are affected by, have an interest in or have influence on the work or output of the system
- Goals are set by the stakeholders, who have expressed the need for the project and have specific attributes or benefits they want the new system to provide.

**Define Scope**:

Defining scope in business analysis refers to the process of determining the boundaries and limitations of a project in terms of its objectives, deliverables, tasks, and stakeholders involved. It is a crucial step in defining requirements and helps to ensure that all members of the project team have a clear understanding of what is included and excluded from the project. The scope should be well-defined and communicated to avoid scope creep and ensure that the project stays on track and achieves its intended outcomes.

**FORMALITY GUIDE**

Rabbit projects

- Sketch of the project work
- Brief meeting necessary to gain consensus of all stakeholders
- Document scope

Horse projects

- More formal and need a blast off meeting
- Results are communicated to appropriate people
- Deliverables are recorded and distributed
- Sign off from stakeholders required

Elephant projects

- Formal meeting required
- Detailed information documented, reviewed and signed off
- Should have the added step of having the quality team review their deliverables
- May be more than one meeting required



#### 3.Stakeholders

> Stakeholders are the source of requirements, as they represent end users as well as anyone who has influence or an affect on the project.

 They can include the project team, clients, end-users, and other groups that will be affected by the project. Identifying stakeholders early on in the project is important as their needs and expectations must be taken into account throughout the project.

Here are some of the most common stakeholders.

- Project Sponsor
- Customer
- End Users
- Consultants and Vendors
- Management
- Subject Matter Experts
- Project Team/Core Team

Things to consider regarding stakeholders:

- Each will have their own set of requirements
- The BA must determine how to make decisions to satisfy all stakeholders
- By definition a stakeholder is someone who has an interest in the project
- Projects can have many stakeholders
- It is crucial when determining the key stakeholders to review the goal of the project



#### 4.Goals

In order to stay focused on achieving the scope of the project, the project team will need to agree on goals. If you think of the overall goal of the project, all of the detailed requirements you define must support this goal.

One method of determining a goal is to start with a **problem statement**. This clearly states what problem your project is aiming to solve.Writing the goal statement can then be done using a three-pronged approach - purpose, advantage and measurement.

#### 5. Constraints, risks 

> Constraints are limitations that the project team must work within, such as budget, time, and resources. Risks are potential problems that may arise during the project and can have an impact on the project's success. Identifying and managing these constraints and risks is important for the project team to ensure that they are aware of potential issues and can take steps to mitigate them.

**REQUIREMENTS CONSTRAINTS**

- Constraints are set by the scope and management of the project
- Could include items such as dates, money

**SOLUTION CONSTRAINTS**

- These could be design solutions, systems, operating platforms etc.
- An example of a solution constraint is being mandated to use out-of-the-box software or limited customization

**PROJECT CONSTRAINTS**

- Includes items such as schedule, budget variance & priorities
- Small budgets and impossible deadlines can cripple projects

**RISKS**

When beginning a project, it is important to complete an assessment of risks. While this is normally led by the Project Manager, a BA will often participate in risk identification and documentation.

- Something always goes wrong on every project
- At this point in the project, high level risks must be identified

#### 6. Naming conventions

> Naming conventions refer to the rules and guidelines for naming files, folders, and other elements within a project. Having a consistent naming convention makes it easier for the project team to locate and reference specific elements and improves overall organization.

- Each project has different products and naming
- Stakeholders and clients must all understand and agree on terminology to be used in each project
- Glossary must be included in all documentation



#### 7. Cost

**COSTS**

- How much is this going to cost
- Project work is expensive and teams need to know if this is acceptable to the business
- BAs must be prepared to estimate how long the requirements gathering phase will last
- Other costs to be considered are:
  - Contract costs
  - Software/hardware required
  - Training

GO/NO GO

- This is where the decision is made to proceed with the next phase of the project
- All aspects are considered before making this decision
- The decision must be made on the facts

### **Learning Outcomes:**

After completing this module, you should be able to:

#### 1. Describe how a project is started

Projects typical start with a kickoff, or blastoff, that brings together the key stakeholders and project team members to begin the project. While at this stage not all project team members will be on board, a BA is often engaged and works with the Project Manager to gather the data and prepare the documentation used for the kickoff meeting.

**DELIVERABLES OF PROJECT BLASTOFF**

- Purpose of the project - in order to determine where to start the requirements gathering, the BA must understand what the project is striving to achieve
- Project Scope - the BA must understand the functional areas involved, what is to be included and excluded
- Stakeholders - it is critical to understand who the stakeholders are and who will be providing the requirements
- Who will be using the product
- Who will be impacted
- Who will be supporting the product
- Constraints - what are the constraints if any
- Names - are there any terminology that must be used
- Facts & Assumptions - what do the BAs need to know
- Estimated cost - what is the anticipated cost of this project - how much time and resources will this project involve
- Risks - what are the risks involved
- Go/no go - does the project proceed

####  2.Understand the definition of scope and how to set it

Scope refers to the boundaries and limitations of a project in terms of its objectives, deliverables, tasks, and stakeholders involved. It defines what is included and excluded from the project. Setting the scope involves determining the project's goals, defining the work that needs to be done to achieve these goals, and establishing clear boundaries and limitations for the project.

To set the scope, the following steps can be taken:

1. Define the project goals and objectives: This includes understanding what the project aims to achieve and what it will deliver.
2. Determine the project requirements: This includes identifying what needs to be done to achieve the project goals and what outcomes are expected.
3. Define the deliverables: This includes identifying the products, services, or outcomes that will be produced as part of the project.
4. Identify the stakeholders: This includes determining who will be impacted by the project and who needs to be involved in the project.
5. Establish the project constraints: This includes identifying the budget, timeline, and other limitations that will impact the project.
6. Assess the risks: This includes identifying potential risks and developing a plan to mitigate or manage them.

Once the scope has been established, it is important to communicate it to all members of the project team to ensure that everyone has a clear understanding of what is expected. The scope should also be reviewed and updated regularly throughout the project to ensure that it remains relevant and aligned with the project goals and objectives.

#### 3.Understand the role of stakeholders in defining requirements

Stakeholders play a crucial role in defining requirements for a project. They are individuals or groups that have a vested interest in the project and can be impacted by its outcomes. The role of stakeholders in defining requirements includes:

#### 4.Understand how to define constraints and the risks

Defining constraints and risks is an important step in project planning and management.

Constraints are factors that limit the options available to a project and can impact its ability to achieve its goals. Common project constraints include budget, timeline, resources, and regulatory requirements. To define constraints, it is important to identify what limitations exist for the project and how they will impact the project goals and objectives.

Risks refer to potential events or circumstances that could negatively impact a project and its ability to achieve its goals. To define risks, it is important to identify what could go wrong with the project, assess the likelihood of these events occurring, and determine the potential impact on the project.

To define constraints and risks, the following steps can be taken:

1. Identify constraints: This includes understanding what limitations exist for the project, such as budget, timeline, resources, and regulatory requirements.
2. Assess the impact of constraints: This includes determining how the constraints will impact the project goals and objectives and what options are available to mitigate or manage these impacts.
3. Identify risks: This includes understanding what events or circumstances could negatively impact the project and its ability to achieve its goals.
4. Assess the likelihood and impact of risks: This includes determining the likelihood of each risk occurring and the potential impact on the project if it does occur.
5. Develop a risk management plan: This includes developing strategies to mitigate or manage the risks, such as contingency plans or risk mitigation strategies.

Once the constraints and risks have been identified and assessed, it is important to communicate them to all members of the project team and to regularly review and update them throughout the project. This helps to ensure that the project stays on track and achieves its intended outcomes.

#### 6.Understand why naming conventions are needed

- Each project has different products and naming
- Stakeholders and clients must all understand and agree on terminology to be used in each project
- Glossary must be included in all documentation

Naming conventions are a set of rules for naming files, folders, variables, and other elements in a project. They are needed because they help to:

1. Ensure consistency: Naming conventions ensure that all elements in a project are named in a consistent and predictable manner, making it easier for team members to understand and work with the elements.
2. Improve organization: Naming conventions can help to organize and categorize elements in a project, making it easier to find and manage them.
3. Avoid conflicts: Naming conventions can help to avoid conflicts that can occur when multiple elements have the same name or are named in a confusing or unclear way.
4. Facilitate communication: Naming conventions can help to facilitate communication between team members by ensuring that everyone uses the same terms and conventions when referring to elements in a project.

In summary, naming conventions are needed to ensure consistency, improve organization, avoid conflicts, and facilitate communication within a project. By following a set of naming conventions, projects can run more smoothly, be easier to understand and manage, and achieve their goals more effectively.

#### 7.Understand the definition of project costs

Project costs refer to the financial resources required to complete a project, including both direct and indirect costs.

Direct costs are the expenses that can be directly attributed to the project, such as materials, labor, and equipment. These costs are usually directly tied to the project scope and can be easily calculated.

Indirect costs, also known as overhead costs, are the expenses that are not directly tied to the project but are still necessary for its successful completion. Examples of indirect costs include office rent, utilities, and administrative expenses.

#### 8.Understand how all of this information determines value at the beginning of a project.

All of the information gathered at the beginning of a project, including the scope of work, stakeholders, end-users, constraints, risks, naming conventions, and project costs, helps to determine the value of the project.

1. Scope of work: The scope of work defines what the project will deliver and what it will not deliver, which helps to determine the value that will be delivered to stakeholders.
2. Stakeholders: Understanding the stakeholders and their needs helps to determine what value the project will deliver to them, and how that value will be received.
3. End-users: Understanding the needs of the end-users helps to determine what value the project will deliver to them and how it will meet their needs.
4. Constraints: Understanding the constraints and risks associated with the project helps to determine the level of investment required to deliver the desired value.
5. Naming conventions: Understanding the naming conventions for the project helps to ensure that all elements of the project are named consistently and in a way that makes sense, which helps to ensure that the project is delivered on time and on budget.
6. Project costs: Understanding the project costs helps to determine the value that will be delivered by the project and how the project will be funded.

By understanding all of this information at the beginning of a project, the project team can better determine the value that the project will deliver, how that value will be received, and how the project will be funded and executed. This information is critical for ensuring that the project is completed successfully and that the desired value is delivered to stakeholders.
