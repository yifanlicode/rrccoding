## Topic 1: Systems Development Life Cycle

#### **Systems Development Lifecycle**

Organizations utilize a standard approach to system development. The approach, also known as the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC), has several phases and companies differ on the identification of each phase.

The following diagram identifies phases of a SDLC:

![img](%20%20Module1Introduction%20to%20Systems%20Development%20.assets/pic009.gif)

1. Planning: This is the first phase of the SDLC and the focus is to identify the scope of an approved project. A problem is identified and an assessment of the solution is created which identifies a project. The project is then compared to other projects to determine which project the company will work on. Once it has been determined which project to work on, the project definition and scope are clearly identified. There are several documents that can be created during this phase, some of which are: Business Case, Statement of Work, Project Plan, Gantt and / or Pert Chart, Project Workbook, Project Feasibilities, and Project Approval.
2. Analysis: This is the second phase of the SDLC and the focus is to analyze the current and future systems. Once the project has been identified, the Business Analyst can start to gather and structure requirements, analyze findings, build prototypes, and define / recommend a solution. There are several types of documents that can be created during this phase, some of which are: Use Cases, Flow Charts, Worksheets, Decision Tables, Pareto Charts and Prototypes of the new system.
3. Design: This is the third phase of the SDLC and the focus is to complete the Design of the new system. The design specifies the characteristics of the new system. Depending on the approach taken to development, the design phase could occur before the Analysis phase has completed. This phase would create documents that illustrate the Logical and Physical Design of networks, applications, interfaces and databases.
4. Implement: This is the fourth phase of the SDLC and the focus is to create a system. There are many approaches to development and several programming languages that could be used. Depending on the approach taken, development can occur before the Analysis is completed for all components, however the danger is that you re-develop a component based on new information. This phase also has many activities that include: Application Build, Integration into existing systems, Implementation, Data Conversion, Training, Testing (unit / system / client acceptance).
5. Support: This is the fifth and final phase of the SDLC and the focus is to support the implemented system. During this phase, maintenance areas and enhancements can be identified. Also note that the final stage, Support has an arrow back to Planning. The purpose of the link is for enhancements. Even though the SDLC approach was used for the initial build of the application, the same approach is used for enhancements.

Note, It is not uncommon to have a project going through phases at the same time. In addition, not all projects are managed the same way. Today, it is becoming more common to implement technology projects using Agile methodology which allows for projects to be managed iteratively - instead of completing separate phases sequentially, development is done and tested and approved in smaller increments that build upon each other to get to completion.



## Topic 2: Essentials of a Business Analyst

Business analysts (BA) can play many roles on a technology project. The roles vary from project to project, and this makes it difficult to clearly articulate the specific skills and characteristics a BA should have. 

Overall, there are four things that a BA must keep in mind:

1. Plan ahead. Know what your next step is and where it will take you. This demonstrates to the business clients that you are on top of things. Therefore the BA must take the time to plan the approach.
2. Know your audience. Everything we do requires some level of communication and by understanding the audience, you ensure that your communication is accepted and will produce the desired responses. Therefore the BA must alter the mode and content of the communication based on the audience.
3. Different Approaches. "When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail." Not every project or task will be exactly the same and realizing this ensures we are prepared to find the best approach for solving the problem. The BA needs to understand this and what the different approaches are.
4. Expectations. Managing expectations is the key, because at times we cannot meet what is expected of us. The reasons for not meeting the expectation can be internal to the BA or external factors that the BA cannot influence. Therefore, understanding the expectation and managing it can influence the success of the BA.



## Topic3:Skills and Characteristics of a Business Analyst

#### **Why do we study Business Analysis?**

![img](%20%20Module1Introduction%20to%20Systems%20Development%20.assets/pic003.gif)

Business analysis is a role for most organizations in the System Development Life Cycle where the primary purpose is to study the problems and needs of an organization in order to determine how people, methods, and information technology can be best combined to bring about improvements in the organization. Traditionally, companies would use key business staff or IT personnel to define the requirements, however there were concerns with both groups being too focused on either the business or IT. What was needed was someone to bridge the gap between the two groups and be disciplined to gather compete and correct requirements.

#### **Roles of a Business Analyst**

Business analyst (BA) roles vary from company to company with emphasis put on specific activities. Different roles that a BA can have are:

- Strategic Planning - Facilitate the creation of plan
- Process Modeling - Define the current state and create a future state.
- Change Management - Define and create roles / responsibilities and the transition of people into the new roles.
- Facilitators - Lead meetings
- Documenters - Document findings & meetings
- Trainers - Train business staff on the new system
- Testers - Assist in system and/or client acceptance testing
- Cost / Benefit Analysis - Identify the costs, benefits and ROI for projects
- Support - Assist with the support of an application
- Researcher - Research topics for the business and IT

#### **Skills of a Business Analyst**

Depending on the role, specific skills will be required, however there are three key skills that stand out.

- Communication
- - Oral - ability to prepare & deliver information to individuals, small groups or large audiences through a presentation and/or series of questions. The BA will spend most of their time talking with individuals to gather and explain information. The ability to communicate orally allows the BA to articulate the specific issues, objectives or suggestions. There also needs to be a comfort level in oral communication. The BA should be comfortable with leading large groups and being assertive in their role of facilitating meetings, which can be demonstrated through oral communication.
  - Written - ability to create documentation about a system, process or business activity. The format of the documentation can take many forms: Use Cases, Process Flows or Diagrams. The ability to articulate the requirements through written communication allows the BA to clearly identify the requirements and demonstrate their understanding of them to the business. Clearly written requirements will also assist with the analysis because it can highlight gaps or conflicts.
- Listening - A significant part of a BA's role is listening to users and to help in turning sometimes vague and ambiguous descriptions into a focused analysis of their needs. For most people listening to users can be difficult, especially if it is for a long period of time, because our mind tends to wander, or we find the topic not interesting, or the user takes too long to explain the need / concern. To help you stay focussed and listening to the user, try the following tips:
  - Maintain eye contact with the user - this keeps us focussed on the user and listening to them. The user also feels that they have our attention.
  - Key notes - by writing notes about the information the user is communicating keeps us focussed on what they are saying. It is not necessary to write everything down, and could be impossible, however it is important to keep documenting some of the information, even if you will not need it because it keeps us focussed on them.
  - Recap what you have heard - occasionally if you recap what the user has been discussing, it illustrates that you have been listening and understand the information. It also ensures that your understanding is correct and allows the user to clear up any confusion.
- Analysis - Ability to understand the problem and determine if the information gathered is complete. Also the ability to review the information and determine a solution for the problem. The BA's ability to piece all the information together will be important, because the analysis piece is like building a puzzle. You need to take all of the pieces of information and create a picture of the current or future system. The analysis part occurs when you are trying to determine if the picture is complete, has missing pieces or has incorrect pieces. We cannot expect that the users will provide all the information or provide correct / complete information. Most of the time incomplete information occurs without their knowledge because they can be so close to the topic. Therefore, the BA must do the analysis of the information and determine if it is complete.

#### **Characteristics of a Business Analyst**

Along with the identified skills, there are also key characteristics that business analysts should have:

- Impertinence - Question everything. The BA should never assume that they understand a system function (component), even if they have worked on similar systems. Most of the information may be the same, but each company / system has unique characteristics that need to be identified and explored.
- Impartiality - Find the "best" solution. Each BA has unique experiences that will impact our judgment and we need to minimize their impact. Experiences can be a great guide that will identify areas to be concerned about, but they should limit our scope when identifying possible solutions.
- Relaxing constraints - Assume anything is possible and eliminate the infeasible. Users are quite often limited by what they know and the current limitations of an existing system. The BA needs to assist the user in "thinking outside of the box", exploring other ways to complete the task. Some users will be willing to do this because they have heard about what other systems were able to offer. It then becomes the BA's responsibility to ensure that the expectations of the users can be met.

- Attention to details - Looking for complete and correct information. As identified under Impertinence, we can often overlook areas because we believe we understand it and then it causes the project problems because specific details were missed. As the BA, we need to take all the pieces of the puzzle (project, system, need) and ensure that we have all of them and that the pieces all fit.
- Reframing - Be open minded to other ideas. Often users have unique ideas for the system and we need to be careful about discounting them to early. We need to remember that they are the experts for their processes and we should be open minded about their approach. Analysis is, in part, a creative process so we should be willing to explore all options that are available.

Since the role of a business analyst can be many things, a BA should have some understanding of the following areas:

- Business knowledge - understanding of business activities. This knowledge will assist the BA to understand some of the unique characteristics of the business. This limits how much the business needs to educate you on what they do and allows you to focus on how they do it.
- Technology knowledge - understanding of technology. This knowledge will assist the BA in setting expectations with the business. The business may not know or understand the limitations of the system and an understanding of technology will assist them in defining what can or cannot be done.
- Managerial knowledge - ability to manage other people. Whether the BA becomes the Project Manager or not, the BA will manage people. They will be managing the gathering of requirements and requirements are from people, therefore they end up managing the people to get the requirements. Other times they may also manage the technical people in the development of a new system.

To be proficient in all of the above areas would require someone to have several years of experience and involvement in many different projects. So, can you still be a good BA if you don't have all of the above knowledge? The answer is Yes. Recognizing where you need assistance allows you to supplement it during the project with other people that have the experience / skills.

## Topic 4: Project Teams in Systems Development

#### **Project Team Roles**

Most often, systems development is undertaken by creating a formal project team. Projects are assigned resources (people and money) to produce a specific result or product within a set time. Project teams may be made up of staff resources as well as contracted resources. 

Keep in mind that all projects are not equal and will have different organizational structures. Here are some of the most typical roles involved in systems projects. Roles will vary by the nature of the project, as well as the methodology used to manage the project.  

- Project Sponsor – represents the business and oversees the project. Accountability for the project is assigned to a Project Manager who will report directly to the Project Sponsor. 

- Business Lead – represents the operational or functional area that will own the system after the project ends 

- Project Manager – coordinates activities of all team members and manages the resources and budget to deliver the project on time 

- Systems Analyst – analyzes the current systems used and recommends solutions to meet business requirements 

- Organizational Change Management – prepares end users to use the new system 

- Users – representation from the various groups who will use the system
