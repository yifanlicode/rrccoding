# Module 3 â€“ Getting Started on a Systems Development Project

 

### Topics

- Project blastoff or kickoff 

  > This refers to the initial phase of a systems development project where the project team is assembled, objectives are defined and the overall project plan is established. This is the starting point of the project where the project team is formed, stakeholders are identified and the project scope is defined.

- Scope

  > The scope of a project refers to the specific deliverables and objectives that need to be achieved for the project to be considered successful. It outlines what the project will and will not include, and serves as a guide for the project team to focus on the tasks necessary to complete the project.

- Stakeholders

  > Stakeholders are individuals or groups that have an interest in the project and its outcome. They can include the project team, clients, end-users, and other groups that will be affected by the project. Identifying stakeholders early on in the project is important as their needs and expectations must be taken into account throughout the project.

- Goals

- Constraints, risks 

  > Constraints are limitations that the project team must work within, such as budget, time, and resources. Risks are potential problems that may arise during the project and can have an impact on the project's success. Identifying and managing these constraints and risks is important for the project team to ensure that they are aware of potential issues and can take steps to mitigate them.

- Naming conventions

  > Naming conventions refer to the rules and guidelines for naming files, folders, and other elements within a project. Having a consistent naming convention makes it easier for the project team to locate and reference specific elements and improves overall organization.

- Cost

- Go/ no go

  

### **Learning Outcomes:**

After completing this module, you should be able to:

#### 1. Describe how a project is started

Projects typical start with a kickoff, or blastoff, that brings together the key stakeholders and project team members to begin the project. While at this stage not all project team members will be on board, a BA is often engaged and works with the Project Manager to gather the data and prepare the documentation used for the kickoff meeting.

These topics will be discussed in detail in the following pages of this module.

- This is an activity that starts the entire process
- May last a few hours or several days - depends on the size of the project
- Identifies the work area and the purpose of the product
- Identifies the stakeholders
- This activity can be known as project kick off, initiation, or launch depending on the organization
- It is used to lay the ground work or foundation of the project
- It is crucial for the effectiveness of the requirements

**DELIVERABLES OF PROJECT BLASTOFF**

- Purpose of the project - in order to determine where to start the requirements gathering, the BA must understand what the project is striving to achieve
- Project Scope - the BA must understand the functional areas involved, what is to be included and excluded
- Stakeholders - it is critical to understand who the stakeholders are and who will be providing the requirements
- Who will be using the product
- Who will be impacted
- Who will be supporting the product
- Constraints - what are the constraints if any
- Names - are there any terminology that must be used
- Facts & Assumptions - what do the BAs need to know
- Estimated cost - what is the anticipated cost of this project - how much time and resources will this project involve
- Risks - what are the risks involved
- Go/no go - does the project proceed

####  2.Understand the definition of scope and how to set it

To build the right product, you have to understand the extent of the work; the people who do it, influence it or know about it; and the outcomes that those people are trying to achieve. This is the **trinity of scope, stakeholders and goals.** All three are critical to developing business requirements.

- Scope is the extent of the business area that will be affected
- Stakeholders are those who are affected by, have an interest in or have influence on the work or output of the system
- Goals are set by the stakeholders, who have expressed the need for the project and have specific attributes or benefits they want the new system to provide.

DEFINING SCOPE

- In order to begin to define requirements, a BA must first define the scope of the "work" that relates to the project
- See figure 3.3 - the work you need to study in an organization is the part of the organization your project will affect
- Equally important is understanding what is NOT in scope
- When determining who to interview for the requirements, the project scope must be set and understood by the project team
- Once set, it is the Project Manager's responsibility to keep the project on track
- However, the BA must keep the scope clear when gathering requirements

FORMALITY GUIDE

How detailed this work will be documented depends on the level of formality that is appropriate for the project.

**Rabbit projects**

- Sketch of the project work pinned to the wall
- Brief meeting necessary to gain consensus of all stakeholders
- Document scope

**Horse projects**

- More formal and need a blast off meeting
- Results are communicated to appropriate people
- Deliverables are recorded and distributed
- Sign off from stakeholders required

**Elephant projects**

- Formal meeting required
- Detailed information documented, reviewed and signed off
- Should have the added step of having the quality team review their deliverables
- May be more than one meeting required



#### 3.Understand the role of stakeholders in defining requirements

Stakeholders are the source of requirements, as they represent end users as well as anyone who has influence or an affect on the project.

There are endless ways to define stakeholders on a project. Figure 3.7 shows an example of a stakeholder map. By reviewing categories of stakeholders methodically comparing it to the context of your project, you will be able to identify which stakeholders are relevant, and which ones are important to your plan.

Here are some of the most common stakeholders.

- Project Sponsor
- Customer
- End Users
- Consultants and Vendors
- Management
- Subject Matter Experts
- Project Team/Core Team

Once you have identified stakeholders, they become part of your initial plan. You will also typically document them in a list that outlines their interest in the project, their level of interest and impact, so that you can plan how to engage them for the purposes of gathering requirements.

Things to consider regarding stakeholders:

- Each will have their own set of requirements
- What happens when they don't agree? The BA must determine how to make decisions to satisfy all stakeholders
- By definition a stakeholder is someone who has an interest in the project
- Projects can have many stakeholders
- It is crucial when determining the key stakeholders to review the goal of the project

#### 4.Goals

It is easy to go off track, especially when meeting with stakeholders who often have a wish list of many features they would like to see in a new system.

In order to stay focused on achieving the scope of the project, the project team will need to agree on goals. If you think of the overall goal of the project, all of the detailed requirements you define must support this goal.

One method of determining a goal is to start with a **problem statement**. This clearly states what problem your project is aiming to solve.Writing the goal statement can then be done using a three-pronged approach - purpose, advantage and measurement.



#### 5.Understand how to define constraints and the risks

##### Constraints 

Constraints are restrictions on your project. Some constraints are obvious, such as cost or schedule, but there are also often other constraints your requirements must consider.

REQUIREMENTS CONSTRAINTS

- Constraints are set by the scope and management of the project
- Could include items such as dates, money

SOLUTION CONSTRAINTS

- These could be design solutions, systems, operating platforms etc.
- An example of a solution constraint is being mandated to use out-of-the-box software or limited customization

PROJECT CONSTRAINTS

- Includes items such as schedule, budget variance & priorities
- Small budgets and impossible deadlines can cripple projects

##### Risks

When beginning a project, it is important to complete an assessment of risks. While this is normally led by the Project Manager, a BA will often participate in risk identification and documentation.

- Something always goes wrong on every project
- At this point in the project, high level risks must be identified

#### 6.Understand why naming conventions are needed

- Each project has different products and naming
- Stakeholders and clients must all understand and agree on terminology to be used in each project
- Glossary must be included in all documentation

#### 7.Understand the definition of project costs

The data you have collected so far will help frame the project and set goals related to requirements. In order to prepare for a project kickoff, an estimate of costs (time and cost) will be prepared. All of this data will help determine what is termed "go or no go".

COSTS

- How much is this going to cost
- Project work is expensive and teams need to know if this is acceptable to the business
- BAs must be prepared to estimate how long the requirements gathering phase will last
- Other costs to be considered are:
  - Contract costs
  - Software/hardware required
  - Training

GO/NO GO

- This is where the decision is made to proceed with the next phase of the project
- All aspects are considered before making this decision
- The decision must be made on the facts



#### 8.Understand how all of this information determines value at the beginning of a project.

This module provides an overview of how a project is started, and what information a BA collects to support a successful project kickoff.

At the kickoff, you will have been able to answer the following questions:

- What is the scope of work?
- Who are the stakeholders? How will you involve them?
- Who are the end users? What are their needs ?
- What are the project constraints? What are the risks?
- What is the budget, and the timeline to complete the project?
