Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) 

The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a deliverable-oriented, hierarchical decomposition of the work to be executed by the project team, to accomplish the project objectives and create the required deliverables. It organizes and defines the total scope of the project.



A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a tool used to break down a large project into smaller, more manageable tasks. It is a hierarchical representation of the tasks and subtasks needed to complete a project. 



A WBS contains two kinds of tasks: summary tasks and work packages.

- Summary tasks are the higher-level tasks that summarize project work in some way. The number of levels of summary tasks depends on the size of the project. A few levels are probably enough for a small project. With a large or complex project you could have many levels of summary tasks.

  > Summary tasks are high-level tasks that represent major parts of the project. They are typically labeled with more general, broader task names and contain several subtasks underneath them. These subtasks are called work packages.

- Work packages are items that represent the work that will be done. They can be scheduled, cost estimated, monitored, assigned and controlled throughout the project life cycle

  > Work packages, on the other hand, are specific, detailed tasks that need to be completed in order to complete a summary task. They are the lowest level of the WBS and have specific deliverables and deadlines. For example, a summary task may be "Build a House," and the work packages underneath it may include "dig foundation," "install plumbing," and "paint walls."

Normally the WBS is produced through a group effort. 

You start by using the scope statement and deliverables to identify the top level summary tasks. 

You then break down the work that makes up each of the summary tasks into smaller chunks. 

For a small project the entire project team may be involved in breaking down the project into its components. 

For large complex projects, the people responsible for the major deliverables are likely to meet to establish the highest levels of deliverables.

Then further details would be delegated to the people responsible for the specific work.

 In the final analysis it is up to the project manager and the project team to decide the level of detail that is required to manage the project work



The WBS will commonly be presented as: • A tree diagram that shows the relationships between the various summary tasks and the work packages. • An indented table. asks that are listed and each level of indentation takes you further and further into the sub-deliverables of the project. Work packages are represented by those items that are not further subdivided. • A diagram or 'mind-map' technique. Whatever type of work breakdown structure you use, the project definition you come up with must be adequate to allow for good control while the project is being executed Defining the project is the first and most important step in the planning process. The absence of a clearly defined project plan consistently is a major reason for projects failing. 



The WBS Dictionary helps make sure the WBS can be understood. A short description in a WBS typically is not enough to tell people exactly what they are supposed to do. The WBS Dictionary is a companion document to the WBS. It further expands on details of each element in the WBS. The level of detail you include in the dictionary depends on things like how familiar the work is and perhaps the experience of the person assigned to the task. A WBS dictionary does more than describe the work; it also identifies how you know the task is complete and whether it was completed correctly. You can include the corresponding deliverables and success criteria, information about cost, dependencies, resource required and any other information that you may have uncovered as you and the team created the WBS
