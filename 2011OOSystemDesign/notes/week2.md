Read:Chapter 11 - Mastering the Requirements Process

1. Understand the definition of non functional requirements

2. Understand the importance of non functional requirements



#### Lesson Notes

1.When a product meets all the functional requirements, why would a client reject it?

2.Why are some products never used and why do clients resort back to manual processes?

- The product does not meet the client's non-functional requirements, such as performance, usability, or security.

- The product does not align with the client's overall business strategy or goals.

- The client does not like the product's design or user interface.
- The product is too expensive for the client's budget.
- The client has found a better solution from a different vendor.
- The client has changed their requirement and now it does not align with what was developed.
- The client has internal communication issues and not all stakeholders are on board with purchasing.
- There is a lack of trust or confidence in the vendor.
- There might be any other organizational/political reason internally with the client.

Why

- Lack of attention to non functional requirements could be the reason

- Non Functional Requirements are important.

- They specify how well your product does what it does.

- They are the qualities your product must have or how well it does things.

- They make the product attractive, or usable, or fast, or reliable, or safe.

- They are used for e.g. specify response times, or accuracy limits on calculations.

- They make up a significant part of the specification.

- They describe the character or the way that functions will behave.

- On occasion the nonfunctional aspects of the product are the prime reason for doing the project.

  â€‹	> E.g. Clients find the product to be slow, difficult to use, unreliable.

- Nonfunctional requirements are often overlooked and sometimes this neglect leads to the downfall of a project.

#### FORMALITY GUIDE

- Rabbit projects can use the requirements specifications document 
- To use this document, determine which ones are the highest priorities.
- However, "all of them" is not an acceptable answer.
- Rabbit projects are small, quick and repeatable and cannot accommodate "all of them"
- However, there are some requirements that are needed in all projects including the smaller ones:
  - Support requirements
  - Naming requirements
  - Scope
- Horse Projects have multiple stakeholders.
- Business Analysts need to capture the non functional requirements as well as deal with conflicts between requirements.
- When dealing with different functional areas, they will not always agree in the requirements
- This should be done early on the project.
- Elephant projects need to capture all of the requirements in a written form including non-functional requirements.
- Requirements can be grouped by use case but overlap is common.
- Grouping by type will help prevent duplication.

#### NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:

- These requirements do not alter the product's essential functionality
- They may even add functionality to the product -e.g. add security
- They will be a significant part of the specs
- They could be the difference between an accepted product and one that is not used
- The usability of a product makes a huge difference to all the stakeholders
- The lack of usability can be a real source of client frustration
- It could also result in a lack of support for the BA in future projects

#### LOOK & FEEL REQUIREMENTS

- The look and feel requirements describe the intended spirit, the mood or the style of the products appearance.
- These requirements specify the intention of the appearance and are not a detailed design.
- E.g. - A look and feel requirement could be "The Product shall comply with corporate branding standards"
- Consider the look and feel requirements that you build into your next project.
- Some might be:
- Simple to use
- Approachable
- Professional looking
- Conforming to the client's other products.
- Innovative and appearing to be state of the art.
- You might want to describe the required look and feel by using a prototype.
- Reminder: be careful not to design the solution, because you do not yet know the complete requirements of the product.
- Designing is the task of the product's designers, once they know the requirements.

#### USABILITY REQUIREMENTS

- Usability requirements are often left out of the requirements specification on the assumption that the programmer would not build a product that is hard to use.
- The product's usability might be key factors - do not assume the product will be usable.
- What is usable to one person could be unfathomable to another.
- The usability and humanity requirements make the product conform to the user's abilities and expectations.
- The usability requirements ensure you make a successful product.
- The usability requirements affect productivity, efficiency, error rates and acceptance of a new product.
- Carefully consider what your client is trying to achieve with the product before writing these requirements.
- Usability requirements are derived from what your client is trying to achieve with operability of the product.
- Pay particular attention to usability as it often leads you to discover the differentiating factor between competing products.

#### PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:

- Performance requirements are used when the product needs to perform tasks in a given amount of time.
- Capacity is another performance requirement.
- How fast it has to be, how strong, how big & how often could also be requirements.
- Performance requirements should consider the following:
  - Speed to complete a task
  - Accuracy of the results
  - Volumes to be held by the product
  - Ranges of allowable values
  - Efficiency of resource usage

#### OPERATIONAL & ENVIRONMENTAL

- Operational requirements describe the environment in which the product will be used.
- In some cases the operating environment creates special circumstances that have and effect on the way the product must be constructed.
  - For example - size of area, heating or cooling requirements
- Operational requirements can cover these issues:
  - The operating environment.
  - The condition of the users.
  - Partner or collaborating systems.
- It is appropriate to describe any operational requirements that relate to the successful installation of the product.

#### MAINTAINABILITY & SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS:

- When determining if you have any Maintainability & Support requirements, consider the following:
  - Organization
  - Environment
  - Laws that apply to the product
  - Business Rules

- Keep in mind that your requirements document is a contract to build the product.
- A Support requirement may be if your client may indicate that the product requires to be supported by a help desk or the product must be entirely self-supporting.

#### SECURITY REQUIREMENTS

Security is the most difficult type of requirement to specify.

These requirements can pose the greatest risk if they are not correct.

Security can be thought of as having 3 aspects:

- Confidentiality
  - Allows only authorized users access
  - When writing these type of requirements, they must specific and cover all the circumstances
- Availability
  - Outlines when the product will be available for use
- Integrity
  - Attempt to prevent misuse
  - Detect improper use
  - Handle conditions such as power failure
  - Disaster recovery

#### CULTURAL & POLITICAL REQUIREMENTS

- Cultural and Political requirements are special factors that would make the product unacceptable because of human customs, religions, languages, taboos or prejudices.
- Cultural requirements are often unexpected and at first glance sometimes appear irrational.
- Culture is often taken for granted and ignored
- This can cause confusion for a diverse workforce
- Requirements also exist for purely political reasons
- These requirements are ones difficult to write and rationalize.
- These are often referred to "we have always done it that way"

#### LEGAL REQUIREMENTS

- When determining legal requirements, be aware of any laws that apply to your product.
- Write your requirements for the product to comply with these laws.
- You will need to determine if any laws are relevant to your product. For example :
  - Data protection Laws
  - Privacy Laws
  - Guarantee Laws
  - Consumer Protection Laws
  - Consumer Credit Laws
  - Right to information Laws

#### FINDING THE NON FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

- There are several ways to find the non functional requirements:
  - Use Cases
  - The Template
  - Prototypes and Non Functional Requirements
  - The Client
