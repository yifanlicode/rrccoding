### The Project Charter 项目章程

The **Project Charter** is a document that formally declares the sponsor’s support forthe project. It identifies the project manager and gives them the authority to spendmoney and engage resources to do work.

The Project Charter, at a minimum, will:

- Describe the project - project name and purpose along with a short summaryof the goal and objectives
-  Identify the Project Manager – describing their responsibilities, and a descriptionof the work the project manager will do, and
-  Give the Project Manager the authority to undertake the project.
  Additional information can also be included if available to help clarify what thisproject is all about

You use the project charter to:

- Describe the project objectives
-  Identify the reasons for launching a project
-  Give a basic description of the high-level project scope
- Determine important project deliverables,
- Specify the project timetable,
- List any financial restrictions or limits that may affect the budgetary planning
-  Identify any assumptions or constraints that will affect the project.
  

Once you have approval to start planning the project and your authority as project manager is common knowledge, you are ready to begin the planning process.
