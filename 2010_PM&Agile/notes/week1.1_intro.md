### **WEEK1 - Intro**

As a Project Manager, you will be expected to say what you are going to do, and deliver on your promises. 

Wouldn’t it be nice to have a detailed list of a bunch of best practices that you COULD use to make sure you manage your project correctly? 

The PMBOK is exactly that kind of reference and that’s why we refer to it when teaching you the fundamentals of project management (PM). In this way, you will share a common understanding of how projects can be managed with millions of PMs around the world, and also share the same language and terms.

To help keep things in perspective, the following process map (Table 3-1 from your text) can be used as a reference when you want to get a high level overview of the processes that project managers may employ when managing a project. You DO NOT need to memorize this table for this course – simply use it as a reference to re-orient yourself as you work through the course content from week to week.

### Week 2 – PM Framework

**Reading from PMBOK**

5th Edition: Chapters 1 – 3 6th Edition: Chapters 1 - 2

**Key Definitions & Terms**

- Project. A temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result.
-  Project Management. The application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet the project requirements.
-  Program. A group of related projects, subprograms, and program activities managed in a coordinated way to obtain benefits not available from managing them individually. 
- Portfolio. Projects, programs, subportfolios, and operations managed as a group to achieve strategic objectives.
- Project Management Office (PMO). An organizational structure that standardizes the project-related governance processes and facilitates the sharing of resources, methodologies, tools, and techniques.
- **3 Major Types of Organizational Structures:**
  -  Functional Organization. A hierarchical organization where each employee has one clear superior, and staff are grouped by areas of specialization and managed by a person with expertise in that area.
  -  Matrix Organization. Any organizational structure in which the project manager shares responsibility with the functional managers for assigning priorities and for directing the work of persons assigned to the project.
  - Projectized Organization. Any organizational structure in which the project manager has full authority to assign priorities, apply resources, and direct the work of persons assigned to the project.

- 4 Phases of the Generic Project Life Cycle: (See figure 2-8, phases are at the top of each section)

![image-20230107230357463](week1.1_intro.assets/image-20230107230357463.png)

- 3 types of project life cycles:

  - Predictive Life Cycle. A form of project life cycle in which the project scope, and

    the time and cost required to deliver that scope, are determined as early in the life

    cycle as possible.

  - Adaptive Life Cycle. A project life cycle, also known as change-driven or agile

    methods, that is intended to facilitate change and require a high degree of ongoing stakeholder involvement. Adaptive life cycles are also iterative and incremental, but differ in that iterations are very rapid (usually 2–4 weeks in length) and are fixed in time and resources.

  - Iterative/ Incremental Life Cycle. A project life cycle where the project scope is generally determined early in the project life cycle, but time and cost estimates are routinely modified as the project team’s understanding of the product increases. Iterations develop the product through a series of repeated cycles, while increments successively add to the functionality of the product.

    

- 5 Process Groups:

  - Initiating Process Group. Those processes performed to define a new project or a

    new phase of an existing project by obtaining authorization to start the project or

    phase.

  - Planning Process Group. Those processes required to establish the scope of the

    project, refine the objectives, and define the course of action required to attain

    the objectives that the project was undertaken to achieve.

  - Executing Process Group. Those processes performed to complete the work defined in the project management plan to satisfy the project specifications.

  - Monitoring and Controlling Process Group. Those processes required to track, review, and regulate the progress and performance of the project; identify any areas in which changes to the plan are required; and initiate the corresponding changes.

  - Closing Process Group. Those processes performed to finalize all activities across all Process Groups to formally close a project or phase.

Information is collected, shared and distributed as required. Information must be distributed to project stakeholders in a timely manner. Distributed information will include the communications defined in the communications management plan as well as unexpected requests for information that come up periodically throughout a project.

Project Status Report. A project status report is a regular report that contains information describing how the project is tracking to its plan. It describes:

 Issues, problems, opportunities, and pending decisions related to the project.
 18

-   Accomplishments in the previous reporting period.

-   Expected accomplishments in the upcoming the reporting period.

-   Variance analysis comparing what was planned to what has actually been achieved.
