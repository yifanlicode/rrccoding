# Cost Estimate:

- Labour: both employees and contractors
- Materials
- Equipment
- Services
- Facilities
- Contigency costs(allowed for by the project management team)



Small Project:

Cost estimating/budgeting: can be accomplished by a single person

Large Project:

Cost estimating will be done by one person

Cost budgeting will be done by one person

To estimate labour, it can be by either people-hours,or people days.

### <u>Estimating Sources:</u>

<u>Expert Judgment</u>: uses the expertise of engineers,trades people,consultants,and other experts to determine the costs of project activities. If u donot know yourself, then ask someone who does.

<u>Analogous Estimating:</u>uses actual costs from similar projects to help us determine the cost for our own project.

<u>Parametric Estimating:</u>  uses parameters in mathematical model to estimate activity costs. 

<u>Estimating Databases：</u> Database of costs based on historical data that is availible for some types of tasks.

<u>Prototyping：</u>A small-scale model that is produced, to approximate the final product that will be manufactured.

<u>Computerized Tools:</u> Avaliavle to assist us with cost estimation,such as Execel and MS Project.

Types of Estimates:

1. Order of Magnitude：Least accurate estimate.This is performed during strategic planning.It is often made without detailed analysis of the project tasks.A 'guesstimte'
2. Budgetary Estimate:Further refined from OOM, more detailed planning information is used as input.More of an approximation and used for getting project approvals.
3. Definitive Cost Estimate: Most Aaccurate estimate.Used most commonly to produce the project budget,prepared from detailed, well-defined project planning info.
