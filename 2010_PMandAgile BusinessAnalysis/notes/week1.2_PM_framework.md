#### 1.Define project and project management 

**Project:** 

A project is a temporary endeavour undertaken to create a unique product, service or result.

> eg:Developing a new product, Designing a new vehicle,

- Temporary means that a project has a definite, well-defined beginning and a definite, well-defined end. While the duration of a project can vary greatly from a few hours or days to multiple years, it is finite. It will end.

  > You launch a project to install a hot tub in your back yard. The building and installation project is finite. It starts and ends. The product created, in this case the hot tub, lasts long after the installation project is over.

Creating a unique product, service or result is an important characteristic of a project.

progressive elaboration

- Projects, as we have seen, are temporary and unique. The purpose of a project is to meet its objectives and then end.

- Operations are ongoing and repetitive. The purpose of operations is to keep the business going. Objectives are constantly changing as the needs of the business evolve.

**Project Management** 

PM is the application of knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to project activities to meet project requirements.

Project Management includes, but is not limited to, all of the work that is done to:

- Initiate the project,*/*ɪˈnɪʃieɪt/
- Identify project requirements,
- Determine and set project objectives,
-  Execute the project activities,
- Manage and control the quality, scope, time and cost of a project,
-  Identify and manage risk,
- Satisfy project stakeholders,
- Manage project change, and
- Close the project

Using Project Management skill you can:

- Effectively define and manage the project scope.
- Determine the costs of a project, build a project budget, and track and control the costs and budget as the project proceeds.
-  Develop, track and manage a project schedule.
- Determine the resources (people, materials, and equipment) that are required to deliver the project objectives.
- Manage project communications. 80-90% of a project manager’s job is communication.

Many key factors must be balanced in managing a project. Four important ones are: Scope, Time, Cost and Quality.

Scope, Time, and Cost are often referred to as the Triple Constraint. All three elements need to be balanced in order to effectively manage a project. As one factor changes, one or both of the other factors will also change.
