### Review & Gather

To complete this assignment, you'll first need to gather and review some information.

- [**COMM-1173 Communication Strategies course outline**](https://rrcca-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/jolson43_rrc_ca/Eec0BUXQat1JrZaEztm2K5sBmhxAVvj9DKuSnpY0GabdsQ?e=andDfq) - specifically take a look at the course description and learning outcomes, and recall the work you did during this course.
- **[COMM-2176 Communication for Systems and Innovative Thinking course outline](https://learn.rrc.ca/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=319242&type=content&rcode=rrc-2866419)** - review the description and outcomes for this course.
- **Your other course outlines** - read through the descriptions and outcomes in your other courses this term and note any common or similar topics, language, and assignments.
- [**Communication Strategies**](https://learn.rrc.ca/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=319242&type=content&rcode=rrc-2979392) - this page in the first module of this course reviews the 11 communication strategies that you are learning in COMM-1173; you'll be asked to refer to these in your responses so it might be helpful to have them open.

### Connect & Communicate

You'll create a reflective response to the following prompts.

1. Identify and

    

   briefly 

   explain:

   - The program you are in
   - Your intended future job
   - Your key personal goals for this term

2. With reference to the communication courses you have taken and are taking this term:

   - Identify two communication skills that you are looking forward to building in COMM-2176 this term.
   - Identify how these skills connect to a communication skill that you learned from COMM-1173.
   - Explain why these skills are important to you and how you think you might apply them to your studies this term and your intended future occupation.

3. With reference to your program and courses this term:

   - What are you most looking forward to learning about in your other courses this term?
   - What common themes can you see across all of your courses? How might the skills in all of your courses be interconnected?
   - How do you think the skills you will learn in this course will help you with your other course work?

4. Reflect on your experience in COMM-1173 and other courses you have completed. What is *one* area that you would like to improve this term in this and your other courses? Examples: regular attendance, active participation in classroom discussions, completing assignments on time, starting assignments early.

5. Based on that area of improvement and the skills you identified as something you're looking forward to earlier, identify

   - Two communication strategies you'll use and how they'll help you improve

   - Two goals

      

     aside from achieving a specific grade

      

     that you'd like to set for this course in particular

     - You can use a [SMART goal](https://www.scu.edu/media/offices/human-resources/documents/workday/SMART-Goal-Template.pdf) approach if you'd like to, but as long as the goals are achievable and you identify how you'll judge your success, that's fine

Your response does not need to follow these questions in order! There may be overlap in your answers to each prompt and that's ok; think about ways you can communicate your response in a clear, organized way that makes sense for your own response.

### Create & Submit

Now that you have planned your response and have identified what you need to communicate, it's time to create your communication and submit it!

You can choose to communicate via a **written, video, or visual channel**; regardless of the channel, what you submit will contain your answers to the questions in *Connect & Communicate*.

**Written** responses should ...

- be organized and structured using any necessary headings and titles
- be written clearly with few or no language errors that prevent or affect the clarity and professionalism of the document
- be no more than 2 pages single-spaced

**Video** responses should ...

- have clear video and audio
- be organized with information that flows well, rather than as a train-of-thought stream of information
- be no more than 4 minutes long

**Visual** responses should ...

- use formatting like colours and fonts that are easy to see/read
  - for students with user interface and web design experience/knowledge, consider how you can apply your understanding of accessibility and usability to this submission
- have a clear structure for the reader/view to follow

**Submit your response to the [Setting Goals](https://learn.rrc.ca/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=319242&type=dropbox&rcode=rrc-3011897) dropbox.**
